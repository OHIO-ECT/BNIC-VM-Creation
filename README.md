## VM-Creation and OS Installation

### Goals 
-   Creation of Virtual Machines (VM) on a lab workstation
-   Installation of either Ubuntu-Desktop or Windows inside VM

### Pre-Lab
-   Dr. Bowie's lecture on Virtual Machine concepts

### Resources
-   Hyper-V (part of Windows 11 Enterprise/Pro)
-   ISO files of Ubuntu-Desktop and Windows 11 in the C:\OS folder of each machine

### Task 0 - Destruction of University Lab Machines
Please note that this work is done on university machines so YOUR machine doesn't get broken become non-functional. Please don't TRY and break the lab machines... however, that is their purpose is to have students do weird things on them. 

TL;DR - Try not to break the lab machines, but don't worry too much if something goes off the rails. Get and instructor and we'll help fix it. (Learning Moment!)

### Task 1 - Virtual Machine Creation
This task will walk you through the steps of creating the virtual machine (VM). This is the software construct that the operating system (OS) will install into. It defines all the virtualized hardware that the OS will "see".

1. On the start menu search for "Hyper-V Manager" (blue icon that looks like a bigger and smaller PC next to each other). This console is the primary interface for working with VMs in Hyper-V. It is possible to work with VMs at the CLI (in this case it would be PowerShell), for now that's beyond the scope of this lab.
